                    <p>Ramtek hosts a historic temple of Rama. It is believed that Ramtek was the place where Rama, the
                        Hindu god, rested while he was in exile, Hence it is named Ramtek, According to Hindu history,
                        the ashram of the Hindu sage Agastya was situated close to Ramtek. The present temple was built
                        by
                        Raghuji Bhonsale, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur in 18th century after his victory over fort of
                        Deogarh
                        in Chhindwara.
                        This place is also related to the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa. It is believed that Kalidasa wrote
                        Meghadūta in the hills of Ramtek. <br><br>
                        Ramtek is also known for its ancient Jain temple with various ancient statues of Jain
                        Tirthankara.
                        The main idol of Shantinatha, the sixteenth Tirthankara has a legend associated with it.
                        It became more popular when one of the leading Digambar Jain Acharyas, Acharya Vidyasagar
                        visited
                        and stayed with his sangh in Ramtek in 1993, 94, 2008, 2013 and 2017 for the four months of
                        chaturmas during the rainy season. With his inspiration, a big Jain temple has been constructed.
                        The place was ruled by Gond rulers before being captured by the Bhonsale rulers of Nagpur in the
                        eighteenth century.</p>

                        Reserve-
                        India’s First Ever Dark Sky Park! </p>
                    <p> In an attempt to protect its skies and natural environment from the adverse effects of light
                        pollution, Pench Tiger Reserve has now been declared as India’s first and Asia’s fifth Dark Sky
                        Park.

                        So, the question remains, what are dark sky parks? Dark sky parks are areas designated for the
                        protection of night skies from light pollution, resulting in an environment that allows for the
                        local ecosystem to thrive. These places are not only important for nature and wildlife but
                        equally
                        aid in research for those interested in astronomy. The use of artificial lights to provide
                        visibility affects humans, animals, and hinders the ability to gaze into the celestial landscape
                        with clarity. <br> <br>At the Pench Tiger Reserve, a night observatory has been established with
                        the
                        district planning committee fund and the area near Bagholi designated for stargazing, according
                        to
                        the Deputy Director of the Reserve at Maharashtra, Prabhu Nath Shukla. As such, in the villages
                        of
                        Wagholi, Sillari, Pipariya and Khapa that fall under the Paoni UC Range buffer area, more than a
                        100
                        street lights have been replaced with lights facing the ground to minimize light pollution in
                        the
                        area. According to Shukla, the dark sky certification is a big step when it comes to the tiger
                        reserve as it grants Pench not only national, but recognition at an international level. Another
                        telescope has also been installed at a protection tower at Wagholi, which already has an
                        observatory. With these new additions to the Pench Tiger Reserve, it is hoped to become an aid
                        in
                        education and research for celestial enthusiasts throughout the country.</p>
