                            Seven Sisters Hill, Perjagadh is situated in the Chandrapur District, adjacent to Sonapur
                            Village, 106
                            kilometers from Nagpur. The Hill, which is 459 meters high and 35 kilometers long, is what
                            gives
                            the
                            hill its name, Seven Sisters Hill. Hills named Muktai, Ambai, Nimbai, Mahakali, Lakshmi,
                            Durga,
                            and
                            Saraswati the seven sisters.
                            It is a one-day trip from Nagpur. The best option for weekend getaways.
                            To get there, take the Umrer-Bhisi Highway.
                            It takes approx 2 hours and 30 minutes from the Zero mile Nagpur with zero Tolls. (At least
                            we
                            got zero
                            tolls
                            There was adequate parking space for travelers to park there.
                            A variety of local stalls were also available onsite, including food(snacks only), but carry
                            your own if possible.
                            We grabbed our backpacks with the essentials and began the hike.

                            From below, you would be able to see the hill height,
                            where you could have a glance at a few people standing at the cliff of the hill which
                            reminded me of ANTS.
                            This would allow you to see how far you have to trek.
                            This made us feel more energized and challenged.

                            Trek begins with stairs and it looks like a temple entrance.
                            After a few steps, the stairs ended, and the actual trek began.
                            It’s a slant trek, not a plain trail, but one covered with gravel, stones, and rocks.

                            After 15-20 Minutes of the trek, we felt the difficulty of this trek. (Easy-Moderate Level
                            Trek)
                            I’ve seen few people returning back from the midpoint of the trek because they became
                            exhausted.
                            But trust me, have patience, take as many breaks as you need in the middle of the trek but
                            don’t give up.
                            Because once you reach the top of the hill, the view will make the discomfort negligible.
                            All your anguish will be forgotten. Your efforts will be rewarded by the peace and beautiful
                            vista.

                            It was a dense forest, so dense that the tree canopy prevented us from seeing the sky.
                            Above us, it appears to be like a natural shade.
                            Perfect for hiking on sunny days because it shields your skin from UV rays.
                            We continued on our trek.
                            The vista grew more breathtaking and lively as we drew nearer to the summit.
                            We could now feel the cool breeze, which soon refreshed our souls and carried away all of
                            our fatigue.)
